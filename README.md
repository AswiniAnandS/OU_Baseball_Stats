The goal of this project is to calculate sabermetrics for the games played by the team during 2024 season. This project reads the game data extracted by NCAA software in the XML format and reads through various tags to fetch the basic counts which can be used for advanced computation. Also, I applied a few predictive models to predict a player's RBI.
